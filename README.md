# Heart Disease Prediction

**2022 annual CDC survey data of 400k+ adults related to their health status**

**What subject does the dataset cover?**

According to the CDC, heart disease is a leading cause of death for people of most races in the U.S. (African Americans, American Indians and Alaska Natives, and whites). About half of all Americans (47%) have at least 1 of 3 major risk factors for heart disease: high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and smoking. Other key indicators include diabetes status, obesity (high BMI), not getting enough physical activity, or drinking too much alcohol. Identifying and preventing the factors that have the greatest impact on heart disease is very important in healthcare. In turn, developments in computing allow the application of machine learning methods to detect "patterns" in the data that can predict a patient's condition.
